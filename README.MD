# MAGMA-SSM
This repository includes data to create the statistical shape model (SSM) from the publication: 

"Investigating Acute Changes in Osteoarthritic Cartilage by Integrating Biomechanics and Statistical Shape Models of Bone: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative"

Included are the Principal Component vectors (PCs) and coinciding variances from statistical shape models built for the tibia and femur. These SSMs were built from 113 knee MRIs. 13 of the knees were acquired for the experimental study in the manuscript. The other 100 knees were sampled from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). All knees (local and OAI) were from women. The 100 knees from the OAI include 20 from each of the 5 Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) osteoarthritis grades (0-4). The OAI participants were randomly sampled to have demographics similar to the locally recruited participants - details on participant demographics provided in the manuscript.
